# Week 04: Matrices

## Homework

Read the [chapter of Matrices on The Book of Shaders](http://thebookofshaders.com/08/) and complete all the proposed exercises:

* Using ```u_time``` together with the shaping functions move the small cross around in an interesting way. Search for a specific quality of motion you are interested in and try to make the cross move in the same way. Recording something from the “real world” first might be useful - it could be the coming and going of waves, a pendulum movement, a bouncing ball, a car accelerating, a bicycle stopping.

* Now that you know how to draw different shapes, and move, rotate and scale them, it’s time to make a nice composition. Design and construct a [fake UI or HUD (heads up display)](https://www.pinterest.com/patriciogonzv/huds/). Use the [following ShaderToy example by Ndel](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4s2SRt) for inspiration and reference.

* Watch the following videos and make an art peace in the style of John Whitney:
