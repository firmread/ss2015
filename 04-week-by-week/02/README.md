# Week 02: Shaping Functions

## Homework

Read the chapter about [Shaping Functions](http://thebookofshaders.com/05/) and:

* Take a look at the following table of equations made by Kynd: www.flickr.com/photos/kynd/9546075099/. See how he is combining functions and their properties to control the values between 0.0 and 1.0. Now it’s time for you to practice by replicating each one of these functions on a shader. Remember the more you practice the better your karate will be.

* Port and use one of Golan’s functions to GLSL

    1. [Polynomial Shaping Functions](www.flong.com/texts/code/shapers_poly)
    
    2. [Exponential Shaping Functions](www.flong.com/texts/code/shapers_exp)
    
    3. [Circular & Elliptical Shaping Functions](www.flong.com/texts/code/shapers_circ)
    
    4. [Bezier and Other Parametric Shaping Functions](www.flong.com/texts/code/shapers_bez)

    5. Port and use one of Inigo Quiles [useful function](http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/functions/functions.htm)

* Using a stationary video camera, make three recordings of three different scenes which have interesting motion (go outside!!!). Pick one point to watch during the video, and sketch out it’s motion path using the software you want (or better, your own software). Should look like this: https://vimeo.com/28644982. Try to find both rhythmic (repetitive) and organic motions. Make simple GLSL functions (like the once on the chapter) to replicate some fragments of those motions.
