# Week 01: Getting Started

## Homework

Read all the chapters of [The Book of Shaders](http://thebookofshaders.com/) until the one call Uniform and complete the following exercises:

* Slow down the frequency until the color change becomes almost imperceptible.

* Speed it up until you see a single color without flickering.

* Play with the three channels (RGB) in different frequencies to get interesting patterns and behaviors.

* Figure out how to use u_mouse knowing that the values are in pixels and NOT normalized values. Move colors around

* Imagine an interesting way of changing this color pattern using u_time and u_mouse coordinates

Read [Running your shader](http://thebookofshaders.com/04/) Chapter and tray a shader in OF, P5 and Three.js
